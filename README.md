# Simulation Biological Neural Network

## Description

The brain is one of most advanced CPU known to humanity. In the last decay, his computational power combined with his remarkable architecrure became such a source of inspiration that it inspired nowadays cut-edge technologies, as we can see in the field of Data Science with the appearance of Artificial Neural Network (a project I made can be found here : ...). 

Even though, the brain's complex biological mechnism remains partially unknown, neuroscientist suceed to build models based on ODEs that allows us today to to do simulation that are accurate enough to reproduct brain activity both at micro and macro levels.

As a part job in a Neuroscience Laboratory, we wrote a code that implement an Integrate-and-Fire model in order to undertand the link between the brain's morphology (clusters...) and its activity.

## Features

I personnaly choosed to not share the python code of the OOP class since it is a co-working project with a famous university.
However, here is some features of the project :

- Rasterplot with current input or spiketrain input
- Plot 2D image of the neural network
- Heatmap of the activity (LFP)
