# Simulation Biological Neural Network

## Description

The brain is nowadays still one of the biggest mystery for scientist. However, even though we still don't know all the mechanism inside it, there are still models that allows us to do simulation that are accurate enough to reproduct brain activity at micro and macro levels.

As a part job in a Neuroscience Laboratory, we wrote a code that implement a Integrate-and-Fire model in order to undertand how the link between the brain's morphology (clusters...) and its activuty.

## Features

I personnaly choosed to not share the python code of the OOP class since it is a co-working project with a famous university.
However, here is same features of the project :

- Rasterplot with current input or spiketrain input
- Plot 2D image of the neural network
- Heatmap of the activity (LFP)
